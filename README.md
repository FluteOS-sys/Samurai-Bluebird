# 🪶 Samurai Bluebird Custos Vagans

## 🌌 Overview
Samurai Bluebird Custos Vagans is a cognitive nervous system for organizations—a socio-emotional AI toolkit designed to map team dynamics, morale, and ethical health in real time while preserving privacy.  

At its core, it captures passive inputs (screenshots, app usage, keystrokes), processes them through a **Resonance Lattice**—a dynamic map of meaning—and produces multi-perspective resonance logs and meta reflections.  

This system evolves over time like a living ecosystem, helping leaders and teams navigate complex emotional landscapes.
