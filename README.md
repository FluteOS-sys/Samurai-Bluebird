## 🌌 What Is Samurai Bluebird Custos?

Samurai Bluebird Custos is a modular, local-first AI system designed to passively observe digital environments, apply symbolic cognition, and generate narrative reflections about user activity.  

This prototype:
✅ Captures passive inputs (active windows, typing bursts, screenshots)  
✅ Processes them through symbolic frameworks (72 Sovereignties, Chakras, Context Domains)  
✅ Writes four types of logs every 30 minutes:
- `input_resonance_log.txt` – Raw passive inputs + symbolic tags
- `dashboard_log.txt` – Narrative reflections from Tri-Agent Multi-Mind
- `output_resonance_log.txt` – Reasoning about reasoning (12 Pillars ethical check)
- `witness_log.txt` – Krishna meta-observer oversight
✅ Includes meta-alerts for critical patterns detected by Krishna
