# 🌌 Resonance Lattice – Technical Overview

## 🏯 What is the Resonance Lattice?
The Resonance Lattice is a dynamic, hierarchical memory graph where each node represents a **symbolic neuron**. This lattice embodies the cognitive space of Samurai Bluebird, growing and evolving as batches of passive input are processed.

It balances:
- 🪶 **Familiarity (Order)** – Well-understood patterns
- 🌪 **Novelty (Chaos)** – Emerging patterns requiring attention

---

## 🧠 Node Structure
Each node contains:
- `valence`: Emotional tone (positive, neutral, negative)
- `familiarity`: Confidence level (0.0–1.0)
- `novelty`: Uncertainty level (0.0–1.0)
- `narrative_hooks`: Themes for Tri-Agent
- `planetary_metadata`: Ephemeris snapshot (Sun, Moon, planets, nodes)
- `last_updated`: Timestamp

---

## 🌱 Growth and Pruning
- New nodes created during **inductive reasoning**.
- Nodes refined during **deductive reasoning**.
- Low-relevance nodes pruned or archived.

---

## 🧭 Planetary Metadata
Planetary positions are added as **archetypal time signatures**, allowing future AI models to recognize patterns across time cycles.
