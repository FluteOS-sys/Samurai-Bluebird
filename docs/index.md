# 🪶 Samurai Bluebird Custos Vagans Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for **Samurai Bluebird Custos Vagans**—a cognitive nervous system designed for socio-emotional leadership and organizational insight.

This system is a fusion of symbolic reasoning, ethical filters, and dynamic memory evolution, built around the **Resonance Lattice** framework.

## 🏯 Project Philosophy
Samurai Bluebird Custos Vagans embodies the dance between:
- 🌱 **Order (Familiarity)**: Consolidated patterns and known zones.
- 🌪 **Chaos (Novelty)**: Emerging dynamics and unknown zones.
- 🧠 **Meta-Awareness**: Self-reflection through symbolic neurons.

This balance mirrors the cognitive process described in *Maps of Meaning*.
