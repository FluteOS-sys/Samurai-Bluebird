# 🛠 Samurai Bluebird System Flow

This document describes the high-level data flow within **Samurai Bluebird Custos Vagans**, from passive input capture to symbolic reasoning and meta-reflection.

---

## 🌱 Input → 🧠 Reasoning → 🌌 Lattice → 📝 Output

### 📂 1. Passive Input Capture (Feathers)
- Collects data streams:
  - Screenshots
  - App usage
  - Keystrokes
  - System resource metrics
- Batches raw inputs every 5 seconds (default).

---

### 🧵 2. Staging Area
- Packages raw data into manageable **batches**.
- Assigns timestamps and prepares for framework processing.

---

### 📦 3. Blue Box Frameworks
| Module            | Role                                |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Sovereignties     | Archetypal role tagging             |
| Context Domains   | Environmental mapping               |
| Chakra Mapping    | Energetic state associations        |
| 24 Pillars Temple | Socio-emotional & ethical alignment |

✅ Writes decisions to `framework_resonance_log.txt`

---

### 🧠 4. AMS Core (Resonance Genesis)
- **Inductive Reasoning**: outside-in pattern recognition (novelty growth).
- **Deductive Reasoning**: inside-out detailed analysis (familiarity refinement).
- Updates the **Resonance Lattice** (`memory/resonance_lattice.json`).
- Stamps planetary metadata for temporal orientation.

---

### 🌌 5. Resonance Lattice
- Centralized dynamic memory graph
- Nodes evolve over time with:
  - `valence`, `familiarity`, `novelty`, `narrative_hooks`
  - Planetary signature snapshots
- Daily reflections support self-awareness.

---

### 🧠 6. Tri-Agent Multi-Mind
- Consumes AMS Core output and Resonance Lattice snapshot.
- Generates archetypal narratives for leadership insight.
- Writes to `dashboard_log.txt`.

---

### 👁 7. Krishna Meta-Observer
- Processes Resonance Lattice daily reflections.
- Produces `witness_log.txt`.
- Triggers `meta_alert.txt` for ethical or emotional anomalies.
